Homework:

I thought it’d be fun to try to build a website together, if we manage to do it without encountering merge conflicts I’ll be so beyond proud!
(don't worry if you do encounter a merge conflict, just slack me and I can walk you through it)

I've made an html document which is made up of a header, a main and a footer (there's also a 23 code street logo, which links to the website, fixed to the bottom right corner of the screen).

The main is split up into sections, each person has a section into which you’ll put some content. Just pick one had hasn't been filled by anyone else and fill it out :)

You can style you own section any way you like (it doesn’t need to match, we can build a totally wacky, all other the place, type of website!)

You can also add some styles to the rest of the page if you want (totally optional) but don’t style the whole page (just do a little bit and let others do other bits i.e. if you’re picked the fonts for the header and footer let someone else select the background colours)
  add comments to the css where you style elements that aren't in your section so that everyone else knows what general styles not to overwrite

When you’re styling be aware of **what you’re targeting**, make sure that you’re only targeting your section if you’re styling your section and if you’re style other parts of the page make sure those styles **won’t affect anyone’s individual section**.

!! Right before you start making changes to your local repo: !!
1. make sure you pull
2. send a little message to everyone on slack to let us know you've started make changes
3. make a mental (or physical if your memory isn’t very good) note of what the last commit was on the remote repository

Then code away!  :)

When you’re happy with your work, you can add and commit you changes **but before you push**, check if the remote repository has changed since you pulled (this is why you're made of note of the last commit to the remote repo)

* if it hasn’t – great, just push to master and let everyone else know you’re done and have pushed to master

* if the remote repo has been updated since your last pull:
  * create a new branch and push your code onto that new branch rather than onto the master branch
  * and once again let the everyone else know that you're done and have push to a new branch with a little slack message :)


Does all this make sense?

Please don’t hesitate to ask me (or/and each other) any questions on slack

Happy coding!
